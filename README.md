### Program Description:   
This program replicates a Fitness club with Members, Trainers, and Administrative Staff.     
### ⚙️ Create the Database:  
Ensure PostgreSQL is running on your localhost.    
In pgAdmin4, create a database called "Final"   
In the provided db_conn.py file, change the username and password to your corresponding username and password on pgAdmin4.  
Here is what the line should look like, where 'username' and 'password' would be your username and password  

        db = Database('localhost', 'Final', 'username', 'password', 5432)

⚠️ Ensure these values are correct as they are loaded into the rest of the application and necessary for it to run correctly.
